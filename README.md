# Ai Storyteller

## What it is

Ai storyteller is a simple standalone Python program that runs from
the command line. After selecting some plain text novels to be digested the program builds a trigram language model that is used to generate new stories based on the frequency of words that occur given the previous set of words in proportion to the frequency of their appearance in the given text or text's.

This project was completed as part of the final project for the Introduction to Artificial Intellegence course taught at the University of Washington
